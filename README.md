## Project Description

Use this section to describe your final project and perhaps any links to relevant sites that help convey the concept and\or functionality.

## API and Data Sample

```json

    "footprint": 600,
    "offset_prices": [
        {
            "amount": 2400,
            "currency": "SEK",
            "offset_url": "https://www.goclimate.com/se/flight_offsets/new?offset_params=economy%2CIND%2CSFO",
            "locale": "sv-SE"
        },
        {
            "amount": 290,
            "currency": "USD",
            "offset_url": "https://www.goclimate.com/us/flight_offsets/new?offset_params=economy%2CIND%2CSFO",
            "locale": "en-US"
        }
    ],

### MVP/PostMVP

#### MVP 
- Departure and arrival search box for User.
- Checkbox if flight is roundtrip
- Utilize third-party API to pull carbon footprint data from flight.
- Render carbon footprint data to page, including price of the carbon offset, and link to purchase offsets
- Include graphic of air-travel environmental impacts.

#### PostMVP  
- Add second API that could add useful travel information about the destination city. 
- CSS/Javascript Animation-maybe showing airplane taking off and landing when user submits. Another
  animation could be a random number generator for bringing up the price of the offset.

## Timeframes

Tell us how long you anticipate spending on each area of development. Be sure to consider how many hours a day you plan to be coding and how many days you have available until presentation day.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evalute game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted. It's always best to pad the time by a few hours so that you account for the unknown so add and additional hour or two to each component to play it safe. Throughout your project, keep track of your Time Invested and Actual Time and update your README regularly.

| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |
